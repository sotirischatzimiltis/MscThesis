### Title: A Lightweight Supervised Intrusion Detection System for Future Smart Grid Metering Network
Abstract: The integration of information and communication technologies into the power generation, 
transmission and distribution system provides a new concept called Smart Grid (SG). The 
wide variety of devices connected to the SG communication infrastructure generates heterogeneous data with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and communication 
technologies. Hence, this project aims to design a robust IDS dealing with anomaly SG data and impose the proper defence algorithm to alert the network. An intrusion Detection 
System (IDS) is a surveillance system monitoring the traffic flow over the network, seeking any abnormal behaviour to detect possible intrusions or attacks against the SG system.
